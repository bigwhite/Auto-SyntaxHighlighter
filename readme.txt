Since the first version back in 2004, SyntaxHighlighter has always used Flash to provide copy to clipboard functionality. At first it was Flash 8, then it was Flash 9 and now 10. It's never been a crowd pleaser and a lot of requests over the years demanded Flash to be removed.

Well, it's finally happening -- no more Flash. I think I've came up with user interface to copy code to clipboard which is a lot more intuitive and almost too easy.

If you double click anywhere on the code, the entire code view is replaces with a pre-selected view from which users can copy with a simple Ctrl/Cmd-C. Clicking anywhere else returns the view to the original state. 

= v1.1 =
Enhance regular match.

= v1.0 =
Initial release.
